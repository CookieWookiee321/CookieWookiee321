I'm Michael Cullen, a budding software developer living in Johannesburg, South Africa. 

I've been working on my coding skills over the last year or so. I have training in Java, SQL,
and C# (which is where most of my time these days goes).
I'm interested in making practical desktop applications, and branching out into mobile and web apps later on.

I'm currently looking for work in and out of South Africa.
I'm reachable through my LinkedIn profile: https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-cullen-a08bb8121/
